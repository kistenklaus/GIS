We are muzero the younger and better looking version of
your team from Germany =^). 
Thanks for open sourcing your project,
we took some freedom and made some minor adjustments.

Jokes aside we enjoyed reading through your codebase and
would love to have a chat a EHW. 

If wanna contact us you know how

# How to run
```
$ ./canzero-do-shit.sh
```
This should build, setup our toolchain
and run the control panel.
